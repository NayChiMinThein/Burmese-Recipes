Burmese-Recipes

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

I've developed a project using React and Tailwind CSS.

The concept and details of this project are available in this GitHub repository, which you can explore here: https://github.com/sannlynnhtun-coding/Burmese-Recipes
